This is a game developed using Game Maker Studio 2 for Colorado School of Mines's Game Development course. The code contained here is the source code for use with the Game Maker Studio 2 Engine.

This game is a tower defense/turn based strategy game where players control a group of survivors in a post apocalyptic world overrun by mysterious alien creatures. Players have to explore the map generated around their main town and defend it with limited resources they can scavenge from the world. Revealing the map lets players keep an eye on various enemies and also grants them specific bonuses.
Players explore the world around them by moving various units to places of interest, allowing them to:
<ul>
  <li>Reveal the map and interesting locations or environmental hazards.</li>
  <li>Find Resources (food, fuel, weapons, etc) that give them advantages in combat or keep them alive, or find other Survivors which can assist them.</li>
  <li>Salvage alien tech and turn alien abilities or powers against them.</li>
  <li>Find and destroy alien nests (enemy spawn point locations).</li>
</ul>
